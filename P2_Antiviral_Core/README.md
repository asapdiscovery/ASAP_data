### Storage of data produced by ASAP's antiviral core

The fitness data stored in this repository is structured into separate folders for each antiviral target that ASAP is pursuing, categorized per viral variant. Each folder contains fitness data for the target (if present) as a `git submodule` that is coupled to an external repository where the data analysis has been performed. 

Note that because SARS-CoV-2 fitness data consists of a phylogenetics analysis this is cross-genome. Because of this the submodules for SARS-CoV-2-Mpro and SARS-CoV-2-Mac1 the same.
